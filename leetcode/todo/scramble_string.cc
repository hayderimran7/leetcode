   Given a string s1, we may represent it as a binary tree by
   partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.

   Below is one possible representation of s1 = "great":

    great
   /    \
  gr    eat
 / \    /  \
g   r  e   at
           / \
          a   t
   To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap
   its two children.

   Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, determine if s2 is
   a scrambled string of s1.
